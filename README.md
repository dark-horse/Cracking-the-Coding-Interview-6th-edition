Solutions to some problems in the book Cracking the Coding Interview

These are some solutions to some problems from the book Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th edition.
I did not solve all the problems in the book, some problems because I did not find them interesting, others because I did not have 
the time.

If there is a problem in the book that you think is interesting and deserves a solution and is not here please feel free 
to send me an email (singe_delir@yahoo.com) and I will try to solve it.
