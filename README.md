Solutions to some problems in the book Cracking the Coding Interview

These are some solutions to some problems from the book Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th edition.

I did not solve all the problems in the book, some problems because I did not find them interesting, others because I did not have 
the time. If there is a problem in the book that you think deserves a solution and is not here please feel free 
to send me an email (singe_delir@yahoo.com) and I will try to solve it.

The solutions are all in C, with the exception of Chapter 12 (C++ questions). As such, I skipped the Chapter 6 (math and logic puzzles), Chapter 9 (system design and scalability), Chapter 11 (testing), Chapter 13 (Java), Chapter 14 (databases), Chapter 15 (threads and locks). I did not have time to get to Chapter 17 (hard problems). Maybe I will get to Chapter 7 (object oriented design) even though at the first read most of the problems seem to be more about writing some high level pseudo-code rather than coding an actual implementation.

The name of the file indicates the chapter number and then the problem number. For example, prob.10.1.c is the solution to problem 1 in chapter 10.
